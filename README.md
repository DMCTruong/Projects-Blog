The Blog of Miscellaneous Projects is a website that showcases some of the projects in my GitHub. One of my main goals in creating this website is to use only Notepad++. I hope that by using only Notepad++, it will strengthen my skills and knowledge in developing websites. Feel free to come by and visit! The website is still in development so there are still a lot of content missing or the layout may seem a bit off. The website will eventually finish but until then, please hang tight!
