The Blog of Miscellaneous Projects is a website or blog that showcases some of the projects in my GitHub. Creating the website also serves to help me become a better developer. Feel free to come by and visit! The website is still in development so there are still a lot of content missing or the layout may seem a bit off. The website will eventually finish but until then, please hang tight!

# Currently: 
- Working on adding more information about the projects.

# To-do List:
- Add a color-picker
- Add a page about the website's background
- Redo styling on project pages
- Reformatting the html so that it's more readable
