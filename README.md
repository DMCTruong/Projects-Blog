The Blog of Miscellaneous Projects is a website or blog that showcases some of the projects in my GitHub. Creating the website also serves to help me become a better developer. Feel free to come by and visit! The website is still in development so there are still a lot of content missing or the layout may seem a bit off. The website will eventually finish but until then, please hang tight!
