The Blog of Miscellaneous Projects is a website or blog that showcases some of the projects in my Github. I am mostly using the website to experiment and practice with web development and technologies. Feel free to come by and visit! The website is still in development so there are still a lot of content missing. The website will eventually fill out but until then, just hang tight! Also, a lot of the images on the website are just pretty placeholders while the real images are being drawn or rendered. But for now, the text, content, and layout for the projects takes priority.

# Currently: 
- Working on adding information about the projects.
- Clean up and make it more readable
