                        The server and client implementation is a program written in C. The server can take login information from the client and if 
                        the client successfully logged in, the client can send a message to the server and the server displays the message to the screen.
                        Originally, this project was created for a class project to study. It will be expanded further with added functionality.

                    <h3 id="content_h3">Installation</h3>
                    <p>To install the program, download it at GitHub, and then compile it, make sure the text file is in the same folder as the program. The program also uses a terminal 
                        so the user must have a terminal installed to run it.</p>
                    <!-- Download at GitHub-->
                    <p>Be sure to check out the instructions in the README if you would like to download.</p>

                    <h3 id="content_h3">Usage</h3>
                    <p>To run the program, run the server and client programs on separate terminals. Be sure to run the server program first then the client. Then enter a user name and password listed on 
                        the server terminal and wait for the server to verify and accept it. Then the user may enter a message and send it to the server. If all goes well, the server should send the message right back.</p>
