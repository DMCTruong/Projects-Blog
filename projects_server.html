                        The Socket Stream Server and Client Implementation was a small project created for class to study about the inner workings of servers and their clients.
                        The server can take login information from the client and if the client is successfully logged in, the client can send a message to the server from which 
                        the server displays the received message to the screen. The project will be expanded further in the future with added functionality.

                        <p>To use the program:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Run the compiled server program first on one terminal, then leave the server program as it is.</li>
                            <li>Next, run the compiled client program on a separate terminal</li>
                            <li>On the client terminal, enter one of the user name and password pairs that is included in the passwd.txt. Then, wait for the server to verify and accept it.</li> 
                            <li>If the server accepts the user name and password, the user may enter a message and send it to the server. If all goes well, the server should send the message right back and that would be the end of the program.</li>
                            <li>If the server does not accept the user name and password, then the user must re-enter the username and password. Be sure that the user name and password are one of the few that is already listed in the passwd.txt.</li>
