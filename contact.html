                    <p>Hello there! Welcome to my web site. The web site showcases some of my projects that I have created and shared on GitHub.</p>
                    <p align="justify">
                        As for me, I am an undergraduate Computer Science student. I hope to be able to become a developer one day. The language that I mainly use is 
                        Java though I am also experimenting working with other languages such as Python and JavaScript. I mostly work with Java applications that emphasized more
                        towards the backend of development. Right now, I am working on my web-developing skills. I feel that being able to effectively present one's work is as important 
                        as developing it. What good is spending hours developing an application if one does not share it? So I hope that you have a fun experience browsing 
                        through the web site and checking out some of the projects that I have been working on!
                    </p>
