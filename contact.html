                <p style="padding-bottom: 40px;">Hello there! Welcome to my web site. The web site showcases some of my projects that I have created and shared on GitHub.</p>
                <p align="justify">
                    I am currently building  this web site and the projects that it features as a hobby to help me practice and expand my skills as a programmer 
                    by making something fun along the process. I feel that being able to effectively present and document one's work is as important as developing 
                    it. The language that I am most proficient at is Java although I am also learning other languages such as Python and JavaScript. I hope that you                     
                    have a fun experience browsing through the web site and checking out some of the projects that I have been working on!
